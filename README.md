## Description

RedactedGPT is a full-stack web application designed for security-conscious professionals. It enables the safe analysis of text data using AI by incorporating redaction of sensitive information. This ensures that any sensitive data is filtered before being processed by OpenAI's API, maintaining privacy and security.

The application features a responsive front-end built with TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The back-end is robustly designed using Node.js, Express.js, and a PostgreSQL database, hosted on AWS. For text redaction, RedactedGPT integrates Microsoft Presidio, a tool for machine learning-powered text redaction, allowing users to safely use OpenAI's API with filtered data.

## Features

- **User Authentication**:
  - Create an account or proceed as a guest.
  - Guests have full access but their saved filter sets persist only for the session.

- **Redaction Filter Sets**:
  - Create redaction filter sets by selecting types of information to redact (e.g., names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, social security numbers, credit card numbers).

- **Prompt Management**:
  - Type in a prompt, select a filter set, and view/edit the redacted text.
  - Submit prompts to the ChatGPT API.
